					<h2 style=color:#090b85; >The Demon Inside: Onslaught of Anxiety Game</h2>
			<p><u>Overview:</u> The concept surrounds a young heroine battling with the never-ending onslaught of anxiety, depression and general loss of hope. The progression of a man trying to live day-by-day as everyone else but having a voice constantly in the back of his mind, creating shapes and bringing back painful memories that continue to make the heroine’s life fall further and further into disrepair. Starting strong and seemingly fine, the idea is to try and portray the fragility of one’s mind using this very actively involved medium. 
			<br>
			<p>By creating a false sense of security and control, the idea would be to throw the “player” into the shoes of a very lost individual. As the story progresses and the man fights to gain control over what they believe to be real, the “player” should be constantly questioning everything that is going on in the world in front of them. What is real, and what are just figments of the imagination? 
			<br>
			<P><u>Motivation:</u> The motivation behind this piece comes from a few rather varying sources. First would have to be from personal experiences taken from growing up, along with friends and family that have struggled through personal pains, to personal struggles through the years with self-confidence and anxiety.  The second key motivator is that of games that we have previously played that really caught our eye and creative edge when portraying difficult topics such as mental illness. The best example of this that springs to mind is a game called Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (Ninja Theory, 2017). Hellblade covers mental illness from a very forefront position, using constant chatter and ramblings to full effect to help portray a heroine fraught with pain and suffering. This game was an experience, as it considered a medium as confronting as mental illness and loss, using this medium to create an experience that has been rarely seen in the video game industry to date. 
			<br>
			<p>Finally, the third motivator would have to be the varying portrayals of mental illness that is present in pop culture today. This includes but is not limited to characters and portrayals seen in the likes of Alice in Wonderland by CS Lewis, the Joker from the Batman Comic/Animated/Movie series’ and the movie Fight Club, just to name a few. Video Games are a medium that I believe are severely underused when it comes to the portrayal of mental illness, due to being a medium that forces active participation of the “player” in a setting built around a story setting. As a story telling medium, Video Games can create scenes and scenarios that are unique in storytelling, especially when being compared to mediums such as novels, movies and tv shows. Being able to create choices, follow your own path in a story, and build your own story based on environmental interactions are something that can truly only be brought to fruition using video games.

			<br>
			<p><u>Description:</u> To begin, the setting idea is that of a more modern era, centered around an office worker with a family. The setting should be representative of a normal household, and loving father or mother, that works day in and day out in order to put food on the table. Initially could sit in a setting where the husband and wife are arguing, creating initial tension and setting up a scene where the heroine leaves the house and goes for a walk down the street. This could set up the first point of negative voices.  
			<br>
			<p>Throughout the experience, I would want to try and use an irregular, yet invisible, voice to act as the game’s main enemy/antagonist. The idea is that the further you progress through the story, the more surreal the voice and its questions become. As a player, you will witness the progression of these events first-hand, initially starting out as family arguments with a little emphasis on the constant “voice in the head”, gradually turning into a battle against the characters own self-deprecation.
			<br>
			<p>As far as in-game mechanics go, there would be a couple of points that would help make the experience more “realistic” as such. The constant chatter from the “voice” would be a focal point of the game, so using full 360-degree microphones to try and match the in your head mentality would be required. It would only be one singular voice, the characters inner mind. The voice isn’t always going to be totally negative either, there will be moments where it can be somewhat motivational, at points in the story when the player is slowly getting through a hard time or has succeeded at something. It is normal for people to praise themselves after all. But this can also then be used against the player, use them to create situations that might feel as though they will lead towards a better outcome.  
			<br>
			<p>Which leads me to my second feature in the game, false and misleading choices. Giving players a choice, or at least seemingly so, is a staple for a well-constructed single player campaign. However, in this instant, this entire notion is to be built in a way that may not be entirely “fair”. Either crafting options at critical points in the story that are either choosing from the lesser of multiple evils, or having the player select from a set of options that have a mix of good and bad responses. However, if the “good” responses are selected, the voice comes back and changes the decision, the voice line to that of a more detrimental affair. Because when you are down, it really is all in your head, and I want to portray this to as an extreme level as possible while keeping the scene of a normal, almost happy looking character or heroine alive. At least, initially so anyway.  
			<br>
			<p>Finally, to match with the choice option I just went through, I would like the game to have at least a few different possible outcomes. This not only assists with replay ability, but also opens the game for further, more permanent, and pivotal story points to occur that feel like they have meaning.  
			<br>
			<p><u>Tools and Technologies:</u> After doing some research into engines that are actively available for upcoming creators, we believe that the use of Unreal Engine (Epic Games, 2019) would be a good base to run the game from. It is a very well-known engine that operates through C++ as its base coding language, allows for full visual importing of scenes and graphics, and allows for full control and creation of a video game from within its bounds. 
			<br>
			<p>Unreal Engine also has a large array of actively available learning tools, videos and articles that would allow amateur creators to slowly learn there way around the system, and therefore caters to individuals of varying levels of knowledge. Along with being an engine that is freely available to use, Unreal Engine has many free to use assets to build scenes and create the basis of a game that would be extremely beneficial for the creation of this project, as we are a smaller team. The less that must be made in-house in relation to prop and texture creation, the better. At least, initially. 
			<br>
			<p>And finally, Unreal Engine has its own in-built lighting system that is rather remarkable. The idea for this game would make use of low-lit environments, and specific lighting-based cues to build tension and create an environment of loneliness that will play heavily into the games overall feel. As at this point writing a lighting system for another engine would not be feasible, having this function openly available right out of the box means that the game can really show off it’s true, dark, colours. 
			<br>
			<p>You would also need suitable computing power to render the game, microphones, and tracking hardware to create human-like characters in-game. Being a game that would be heavily story-based, creating realistic characters with voice-acting would be absolutely required. This would require skills, time, and money that we don’t currently have available, however if this game were to eventually come to fruition, they would be musts.
			<br>
			<p><u>Skills Required:</u> Knowledge of Unreal Engine, C++, graphic design, sound engineering and storyboarding would be the main basic requirements for the job. There would not be too much in the way of specialist equipment that would be required however, as video game creation is a rather active field with readily available gear. Motion capture equipment would likely be the most specialized equipment that would be required. Finding assistance in the form of external developers, sound engineers, actors however, would most likely be necessary for the project to truly come together cohesively, or at least sooner rather than later.  
			<br>
			<p><u>Outcome:</u> The general outcome of a project of this scope would be to try and create further understanding of the tough topic that is mental illness, no matter how insignificant it may appear on the surface. The outcome at the end of a playthrough would be one of the players creations, depicting an ending based on choices created throughout gameplay. To reiterate, the end impact that this game would be intended to have, is one of further understanding into the mind of someone that is fighting against them. Because mental illness is nothing to squander at.
