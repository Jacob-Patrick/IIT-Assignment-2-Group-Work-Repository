			<p> Jordan has chosen Head of IT at West Technology in Sydney. This is a leadership role reporting directly to the company CEO and involves not only maintaining the IT infrastructure of the company but also communicating with other areas of the business and of course leading the rest of the IT department. He has plenty of experience in Leadership and Management and using those skills in an IT setting would allow for more job options and in this case quite a large expected rate of pay.  </p>
			<p> This is a Management position and Jordan has worked in Management for several years so he believes that his prior experience would be beneficial. He also has several Management Certificates.  </p>
			<p> Jordan believes that his first step towards the skills and requirements for this position would be to successfully complete the Bachelor of IT, as well as continue his work in management to build as many skills as he can. Next, he would want to gain experience in the IT industry and work towards an IT Management position to gain the IT Management experience required, and specifically experience in system migration and integration.  </p>

					<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Customer Solutions Architect - Murray</h2>

			<p> In the simplest of terms, a Customer Solutions Architect takes a client’s desires and needs for their network and makes it into a reality. They are depended upon by all facets of a business for their technical expertise and ability to make customers happy and make money for a business. Murray likes the role as it involves problem solving and vast technical knowledge. It also requires some customer service which he is already competent at, without it being necessary for success in the role.  </p>
			<p> CSAs must have a proven knowledge of network architecture and current products. They must have certificates to show this ability such as CCNA (switching and networking) and CCNP, along with other vendor certificates that aren’t CISCO based, such as Juniper. You will need some years of professional experience in a Similar role as there is a lot expected of you from various stakeholders in the business. He currently does not have any of the certificates, although before he started his current role, he was studying for his CCNA. Murray thinks the first step will be to complete the CCNA, then move on to more technical CISCO certs. At the same time, he would also like to complete certs from AWS, Google and Microsoft for their cloud products. In the long run, Murray would like to be a CSA specialising in cloud.  </p>
