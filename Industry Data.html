			<p>  The job titles for our ideal jobs as discussed in the ‘Ideal Jobs’ section, as well as how these rank in terms of demand from employers according Burning Glass and LinkedIn are described below:  </p>

			<div id="main">
			
		<ul>
			
			<li><b> Data Science Engineer – Ben </b></li>
			<p> Data science has had a boom in demand from employers over the past 18-24 months which would explain why it does not have a representation in the Burning Glass Data. According to LinkedIn there are currently 376 Data Science rolls being offered in Australia. Based off the Burning Data rankings it would have been ranked 16th.   </p>
			
			<li><b> Head of it - Jordan  </b></li>
			<p> A search on LinkedIn found that there were currently 44 listings for Head of IT (or similar) roles available in Australia. It is not on the list supplied by Burning Glass.  </p>
			
			<li><b> Frontend Software Engineer - Jake  </b></li>
			<p> This role is the 6th most in demand role from employers according to the data provided by Burning Glass. According to LinkedIn there is currently 425 advertised positions for this role.   </p>
			
			<li><b> Customer Solutions Architect - Murray </b></li>
			<p>  Burning Data ranks this as the number 1 most in demand from employers. According to LinkedIn there is currently 768 listed roles being advertised. The role can vary greatly in terms of specialisation but generally revolves around network design and cloud.  </p>
			
			<li><b> Test Manager - Sneha   </b></h4>
			<p>  Test Manager is not on the list of desirable jobs provided by Burning Glass. However, according to LinkedIn there is currently 354 positions advertised for a Test Manager role. This would have made it the 17th ranked role in the Burning Glass data.  </p>
			
			<li><b> Artificial Intelligence Specialist - Raj </b></li>
			<p> This role again does not get listed in the burning Glass data. However, LinkedIn shows that there are currently 819 roles advertised in Australia. The role is quite broad so there are more specialised roles, but it is still clearly a much sought out specialisation amongst prospective employers.   </p>
		</ul>	
			
			<p>  Our group skillset is made up of the skills that we have identified as being required for our ideal jobs. These skills have been listed below and divided into two groups - general skills and IT-specific skills. The Ranking in terms of demand from employers as described by Burning Glass are displayed in the brackets next to the listings (1 being highest in demand, 2 being second highest in demand etc.). The top skill requirements for the groups Ideal Jobs that are not listed in the Burning Glass data are displayed with red numbers.  </p>
			
			<p>One of the key factors to be mindful of is the role of the marketplace as a mediator. Online marketplaces bridge the gap between sellers and buyers, which is why it is of prime importance to provide effective working cooperation while connecting the buyer and seller.

			<p> Since investigating our ideal jobs and looking at the data presented by Burning Glass, we have had an opportunity to re-evaluate our opinions on our ideal jobs and our individual reflections on this are outlined below:   </p>
			
		<d1>
			<dt><b>Murray -  </b></dt>
			<dd>No, I have not changed my decision. According to the Burning Glass data Solutions Architect is the number one most sought after roll and this is backed up by the current Australian listings on LinkedIn. I already had an understanding on what was required in terms of general and IT specific skills required so this has not changed my decision.    </dd>
			<br>
			<dt><b>Jake - </b></dt>
			<dd>After looking at the Burning Glass Data, my ideal job position of Frontend Software Engineer remains unchanged. It is currently described as the sixth most in demand role and I believe that the job opportunities will continue to grow, so I am quite happy to invest time and effort into further developing the required skills for this position.  </dd>
			<br>
			<dt><b>Jordan -</b></dt>
			<dd>The Burning Glass Data shows that My choice of Ideal job is not the most in demand, however I don’t believe that is reason enough not pursue. It just means I need to prove myself to be the best choice for the job.    </dd>
			<br>
			<dt><b>Sneha -</b></dt>
			<dd> As outlined in the Burning Glass data a testing management role is not the most preferred role. However, given my exposure already in the testing arena and as shown from my behavioural assessment that I have leadership/ mentoring personality traits, I would still be inclined to grow within this area. Regardless, I am willing to apply my knowledge and skills to grow. Also, my interest in testing does not restrict me from gaining exposure and experience in other areas like Cyber Security etc. which I can always do simultaneously.    </dd>
			<br>
			<dt><b>Raj -</b></dt>
			<dd> According to burning Glass data, Artificial Intelligence Specialist does not have many opportunities. However, LinkedIn shows that there are currently 819 roles advertised in Australia. So, I stick with my plan to chase my dream job. I know there are endless opportunities for in artificial intelligence technology and I will work hard to meet the requirement for this role.    </dd>
			<br>
			<dt><b>Ben -</b></dt>
			<dd> Following the Burning Glass data, the Data Science Engineer is a relatively in demand job, with it ranking 16th on the charts, however with its boom in the industry over the last couple of years it is a job that will have continual growth into the future. With that being the case, I do believe that striving for this type of job as a goal would place me in good stead.   </dd>
