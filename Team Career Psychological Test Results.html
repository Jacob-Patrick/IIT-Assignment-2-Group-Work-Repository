			<p> As part of our first assignment in Introduction to IT, we each undertook three online personality tests, with the aim of helping us to identify our behaviour when forming and interacting in a team. We all participated in a Myers-Briggs Type Test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">here</a>; a Learning Type Test <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">here</a> and a third test of our choosing. Sneha and Jordan chose to do the Big 5 Personality test found <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">here</a>, Jacob and Rajaneesh chose to do a Leadership Test at <a href="https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz/">here</a>; Murray took a Creativity Test <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">here</a>; and Sneha also took a Human metrics Jung Typology Test <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp">here</a> The results of these tests are tabled below:</p>

					<h2 style=color:#090b85; >Discussion of the Results:</h2>
			<p> Based on the data provided by these online tests, we are again shown to be quite a varied group. We have a range of different personality types, learning styles, and other personality characteristics. This combined with our varied life and professional experience should give us a good range of skills to work with, and hopefully the strengths of some members can counter the weaknesses of others.  At the same time, it seems as though we have some strong similarities and relatability. While we have a mix of introverted and extroverted personalities, we all share the ‘feeling’ trait so we can relate to each other in that we tend to think with and follow our heart more than people who are primary ‘thinking’ orientated. People with the ‘feeling’ trait also tend to be more empathetic, caring and compassionate, which would give us a strong advantage in teamwork as we will be more inclined to help each other out and be more understanding of each other’s shortcomings and in situations beyond our control (Nature: Thinking vs. Feeling | 16Personalities, 2020).</p>
			
			<p><b><i> Some Pointers to make a mental note of when assessing personality traits and behaviour within a team environment: </i></b></p>
			<li>“What are your strengths and weaknesses?”</li>
			<li>“What are areas of improvement?”</li>
			<li>“Are you an introvert or extravert?”</li>
			<li>“How do you deal in conflict situations?”</li>

			<br>
			<p> <b>We have each reflected below on how we believe our individual test results might influence our behaviour in a team:  </b></p>
			<p> Ben doesn’t believe that these results would affect how he would go about working in a team, as a team is a collective of people that work off one another’s strengths and weaknesses. However, this doesn’t always work out and based on the results of the Myers-Briggs test, he is shown to be someone that is likely to be an empathetic team member that will put a foot forward to aid his fellow group members. Paired with the Big Five test rating him highly on Agreeableness, he feels that his contributing features to the team seem to match well with keeping a team cohesively together.   </p>
			<p> Jordan considers that these tests have shown that although he strives to be open, honest and involved in a group work situation, there is a big part of him that will want to shy away and be that introvert that he knows he can be sometimes. When working in a team he usually is just extroverted enough to end up in a leadership position.  
			<p> Jacob feels that the Myers-Briggs test results show him to be shy and introverted on the outside, but vibrant and passionate on the inside.  He will do his best to maintain harmony in the group but will need to make special efforts to assert himself and put his ideas forward confidently.  As his dominant learning style is pragmatic, he thinks he may be at his best and most useful to the team when working on actual content rather than in the planning and brainstorming phases. As a contrarian leader, he feels that his non-binary way of thinking may help the group to find new solutions to problems, but at the same time, he will also tend to shy away from and defer decision making. 
			<p> The Myers-Briggs test results do not surprise Murray as he is quite an introverted person. Within a team, he believes that he is usually the quieter one and his input it usually more thought out and with meaning. He is also someone that likes to observe and look into all the facts before he makes any decisions or take any actions. As his dominant learning styles are shown to be auditory and visual, he agrees that he has always found that he learns best with visual cues like video or text. He finds that he is creative when it comes to problem solving (He basically does this for a living), and while he is glad that the creativity test shows him to be above average, he admits that he thought it would be higher. He feels like he would be good at thinking through problems and finding a solution that works, even if it is not the most straight forward and obvious.
			<p> According to the results, Sneha understands that she has extraverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits. These results are a testament to her personality type as being a person who is warm, forthright, and known to have strong ideological views and values. With these traits in mind, when placed in a team environment, she generally takes on the role of the collaborator and likes to inspire other team members by working together to implement plans for progress. She works from supportive relationships as her foundation; she is adept in understanding the needs and priorities of others and is talented at building consensus. Also, she is a visual learner and considers herself to be visually creative. Her strengths lie in drawing, building and creating. She engages in learning by using colours and diagrams and learns best from reading, videos, and presentations. 
			<p> Raj describes how the Myers-Briggs test results are the same as his boss’s opinion of him, that is, he is kind and generous and cares about helping and connecting with others. He tries his best to understand the strengths and weaknesses of himself and others. He feels so proud and satisfied whenever he sees those seven ‘Best employees of the year’ in his room. His employers gave him those awards for his leadership qualities, creating a harmonious work environment and relationships with team members, motivating and helping others. He is always inspired by results and criticism. He will consider these test results seriously to improve his character, attitude, communication, leadership and professional skills.
