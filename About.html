			<p> <b><i> Benjamin Saar </i></b> (Ben) is 23 years old and lives in the Dandenong Ranges just east of Melbourne, Victoria. He is currently working as a Service Technician for an IT company in Melbourne and has been doing so for just shy of two years. He has spent many years of his life playing a multitude of sports.

Whether it be messing with bits of hardware and building PC’s or just playing games, technology has always been there. Working in a more technical space and getting to work in a business environment has really opened his eyes to the limitless possibilities that IT has, and how it can be used to make life easier for all.
