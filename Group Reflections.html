			<p><b>	(1) Jake </b></p>
			<p> I have felt from the start that we have a great group and I think it probably comes from the fact that we are group 1 and were the first to put out hands up to start a group. We communicate very effectively via our WhatsApp chat and have used this for our main form of communication rather than Teams. We work cohesively together and as time goes on it becomes more apparent where each members strengths lie and in what areas we can help each other more.   </p>
			<p> I have to say that I don’t think anybody was really prepared for how busy we all are in our personal lives and it has been hard to get everybody together to meet. I think now that we are more familiar with each other, we will be able to get started a bit earlier on our next group assignment and would probably benefit from just scheduling regular meetings from the start and just stuck to them and ran them for whoever could attend, rather than trying to postpone and reschedule.  </p>
			<p> Considering my nature, I was surprised by just how much I have enjoyed group work and working with new people and I feel really fortunate to be a part of such a proactive and friendly group. Through this group assignment I have learned just how very hard it is to organise six people to meet considering everybody’s different work, family, life and study commitments.  </p>

			<li>I think the group did a really good job of coming together quickly and was nice to find out that the group was awesome.</li>
			<li>Everyone was quick to put their hands up to do work, so it made it easy in terms of organising the workload. </li>
			<li>Next time I would like to get a to do list going earlier in the project would have been good as it is always nice ticking things off a list. </li>
			<li>I think we should have probably had organised all the Teams meetings at the start and can be recorded and attended by those that can make it. </li>
			<li>I was surprised with how busy everyone in the group is outside of uni. Was comforting to know I wasn’t the only one. </li>
			<li>I was surprised how close the group got so quickly! Getting to know each member on a more personal level was really rewarding. Specially in these times of Covid19.</li>
			<li>I think this assignment was a good first step in getting to know our group and the small ways we can improve. More importantly though we found how strong we are as a group and have gained the confidence we need to ace this and future assignments.</li>
			</ul>

			<p> Not often have I come across this in team settings, but one of the things that we as a team did well was the way we collaborated and recognised everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Very early on into this assessment, we focused our energy on planning what needed to be done, structuring the contend, and assisting each other when one of us was struggling to complete a task.  </p>
			<p> One thing that really surprised me while working with the members of the team is how well each we work together. Each member of the team is so easy-going, considerate and willing to lend a helping hand where another team member is not able to complete a certain task. Given that mode of study being solely online, I was concerned about being able to interact with other students and being able to gain exposure as you would with on campus learning. But I must be honest I was truly impressed with how quickly each member got comfortable with each other. From the very beginning we created a WhatsApp chat group. On-going communication keeping all members in the loop as to where we are at really helped to build a strong team bonding.  </p>
			<p> One area we could improve on would be to organise a to do list at the earliest possible, assign tasks to team members with a tentative completion date. Doing this would mean that everyone would know the tasks they needed to complete within a certain timeframe. Overall, this project has taught me that teams can operate effectively regardless of individuals being in different locations and time zones. Our team was a prime example of this given that we have members from Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth.  </p>
		
			<p><b>	(4) Raj </b></p>
			<p> Being part of this great team is a phenomenal feeling. I think, strength of my team is effective communication and engagements. All of my team members accepted the differences and helped each other to clarify and recognise the challenges of the tasks to achieve the goal, didn’t hesitated to appreciate for a team member’s hard work or contribution.  </p>
			<p> Good communication is the strength of my team; team members are extremely happy to express their ideas, suggestions and asking and giving feedbacks from the beginning. Regular meetings through Microsoft team, chats through WhatsApp increased the team productivity.   </p>
			<p> I noticed one thing, all my team members are rich with their hardworking, dedication, and pleasant attitude and a helping heart!  Everyone took outstanding efforts to know each other.  Everyone was clear about their role in this group activities and they contributed their part on time with perfection, work together superbly to accomplish great results. Everyone is so generous to share the workload and that made things bit easy. Great thing is that none of them are bookworms; they are a bunch of funny and joyous people, that reduced the stress of teamwork. I feel so proud to work with a supportive, friendly, target oriented team like this. I learned about how beneficial is to work with team members from diverse background.  </p>
 
			<p><b>	(5) Jordan </b></p>
			<p> I am very glad to be in this group. Each member of the group has different skills and strengths that have benefited the whole group in successfully completing this assignment. Everyone pulled together early on and started a good little relationship with everyone, which made working together so much easier. We could have been a bit more organised with meetings at first, but everyone took charge in their own way and made it happen. Working around our busy schedules has sometimes been a challenge but everyone has done their absolute best and I am very proud of each one of them and I am very proud to be a part of this group. I only wish my schedule had allowed me to contribute more.  </p>
