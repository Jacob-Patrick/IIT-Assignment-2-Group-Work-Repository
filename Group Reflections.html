			<p><b>	(1) Jake </b></p>
			<p>I have felt from the start that we have a great group and being 'Group 1', i.e. the first six people to jump in and start a group is a testament to our proactivity and enthusiasm. We communicate very effectively via our WhatsApp chat and have used this for our main form of communication rather than Teams. We work cohesively together and as time goes on it becomes more apparent where each members strengths lie and in what areas we can help each other more.   </p>
			<p>I have to say that I don’t think anybody was really prepared for how busy we all are in our personal lives and it has been hard to get everybody together to meet. I think now that we are more familiar with each other, we will be able to get started a bit earlier on our next group assignment and would probably benefit from scheduling regular meetings from the start running them for whoever could attend, rather than trying to postpone and reschedule.  </p>
			<p>Considering my nature, I was surprised by just how much I have enjoyed group work and working with new people and I feel really fortunate to be a part of such a proactive and friendly group. Through this group assignment I have learned just how very hard it is to organise six people to meet considering everybody’s different work, family, life and study commitments.  </p>

			<p><b>	(2) Murray </b></p>

			<p>I think the group did a really good job of coming together quickly and it was nice to find out that the group was awesome. Everyone was quick to put their hands up to do work, so it made it easy in terms of organising the workload. </p>
			<p>Next time I would like to get a to do list going earlier in the project. It would have been good as it is always nice ticking things off a list. I also think that we should probably have organised all the Teams meetings at the start, to be attended and recorded by those that could make it. </p>
			<p>I was surprised with how busy everyone in the group is outside of uni. It was comforting to know I wasn’t the only one. It was also surprising how close the group got so quickly! Getting to know each member on a more personal level was really rewarding, epecially in these times of Covid19.</p>
			<p>I think this assignment was a good first step in getting to know our group and the small ways we can improve. More importantly though, we found how strong we are as a group and have gained the confidence we need to ace this and future assignments.</p>


			<p><b>	(3) Sneha </b></p>
			<p>Not often have I come across this in team settings, but one of the things that we as a team did well was the way we collaborated and recognised everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Very early on into this assessment, we focused our energy on planning what needed to be done, structuring the content, and assisting each other when one of us was struggling to complete a task.  </p>
			<p>One thing that really surprised me while working with the members of the team is how well we work together. Each member of the team is so easy-going, considerate and willing to lend a helping hand where another team member is not able to complete a certain task. Given that the mode of study is solely online, I was concerned about being able to interact with other students and being able to gain exposure as you would with on campus learning. But I must be honest, I was truly impressed with how quickly each member got comfortable with each other. From the very beginning, we created a WhatsApp chat group. On-going communication keeping all members in the loop as to where we are at really helped to build a strong team bond.  </p>
			<p> One area we could improve on would be to organise a to do list at the earliest possible time and assign tasks to team members with a tentative completion date. Doing this would mean that everyone would know the tasks they needed to complete within a certain timeframe. Overall, this project has taught me that teams can operate effectively regardless of individuals being in different locations and time zones. Our team was a prime example of this given that we have members from Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth.  </p>

			<p><b>	(4) Raj </b></p>
			<p>Being part of this great team is a phenomenal feeling. I think, the strength of my team is effective communication and engagement. All of my team members accepted their differences and helped each other to clarify and recognise the challenges of the tasks to achieve the goal and didn’t hesitate to appreciate a team member’s hard work or contribution.  </p>
			<p>Good communication is the strength of my team. Team members were extremely happy to express their ideas, suggestions, and ask and give feedback from the beginning. Regular meetings through Microsoft Teams, and chats through WhatsApp increased the team productivity.   </p>
			<p>I noticed one thing - all my team members are rich with their hardworking, dedicated and pleasant attitudes and helping hearts!  Everyone took outstanding efforts to know each other.  Everyone was clear about their role in the group activities and they contributed their part on time with perfection and worked together superbly to accomplish great results. Everyone is so generous to share the workload and that made things easy. The great thing is that none of them are bookworms; they are a bunch of funny and joyous people, and that reduced the stress of teamwork. I feel so proud to work with a supportive, friendly, target oriented team like this. I learned about how beneficial it is to work with team members from diverse backgrounds.  </p>

			<p><b>	(5) Jordan </b></p>
			<p>I am very glad to be in this group. Each member of the group has different skills and strengths that have benefited the whole group in successfully completing this assignment. Everyone pulled together early on and started a good little relationship with everyone, which made working together so much easier. We could have been a bit more organised with meetings at first, but everyone took charge in their own way and made it happen. Working around our busy schedules has sometimes been a challenge but everyone has done their absolute best and I am very proud of each one of them and I am very proud to be a part of this group. I only wish my schedule had allowed me to contribute more.  </p>

 			<p><b>	(6) Ben </b></p>
			<p>Right from the get-go I have felt extremely positive about the group that we had created. Each individual person within the group chose to find a group early on, and in doing so we seem to have managed to get a group of enthusiastic and motivated members together in which we can complete this project with. 	</p>
			<p>Communication between the group has been great, with messaging back and forth with plans laid out early in the piece so that we all understood where we were going and who was contributing to what area. This, if anything, was what surprised me the most, as I have had group work in the past that has ended abysmally, with no co-ordination or work getting completed. This has not been the case here at all, which I have found refreshing. Group work can be difficult, and one thing I have learnt is that even though co-ordinating a large group can be difficult, it is not impossible. 	</p>
			<p>Working with a group of people that reside all over Australia, has been a final challenge and difference that I have found interesting, and if anything, I am just surprised by how well we have managed to co-ordinate everything. I have enjoyed working in this group and being able to make the most out of everyone’s own talents has proven to be fruitful for all involved. 	</p>

			<p><b>	(7) Group Reflection </b></p>
			<p>The group on the whole have reported an overwhelmingly positive experience for the assignment 2 collaboration. We have provided some very constructive feedback highlighting some core strengths of the group as well as some areas in which we can improve on for our next assignment together.
</p>
			<p>It is safe to say that each member has found it incredibly rewarding to be a part of this group and  have really appreciated and fed off of each others positivity, enthusiasm and hard work. For those of us that have been in similar group environments for work or previous education purposes, we have been pleasantly surprised by just how cohesively we work together compared to prior experiences.
</p>
			<p>From the start we have been expert communicators and have relished the opportunity to get to know each other better personally and identify each other’s working skillset. We are considerate and empathetic towards each other and take into account everybody’s busy life and work commitments, familial emergencies and time off for holiday’s. We readily pick up where someone has had to drop off and use our full range of skills and capabilities to create a harmonious and productive whole.
</p>
			<p>Over the weeks, we developed some great techniques and tools that aided us greatly in our collaboration including our use of MS Teams to share our individual work and files. There we created a working To-Do-List where we assigned tasks to members with tentative completion dates. When we implemented this us productivity skyrocketed. We agree that by implementing this list early on in our next assignment we will be even more successful as a team.
</p>
			<p>We also feel that we underestimated the amount of time and work involved in getting our report converted to a website and ironing out all the issues involved with our html and css code and getting the website live on github pages. We agree that we will save ourselves a lot of stress by setting up a repository early on next time and building our website in a way that we can see the progress as it is made on GitHub Pages.
</p>
			<p>We recognise that we didn’t have many formal meetings on teams and this is due to our WhatsApp group conversation being so effective. We kept constantly up to date with current and upcoming tasks, personal issues that impacted the group, and provided feedback for each other’s work via WhatsApp.
</p>
			<p>While we held a couple of formal meetings, we agree that next time we should schedule regular meetings and stick to them, regardless of who can attend at the time. We will also hone our meeting skills including chairing, setting agendas and minute keeping.
