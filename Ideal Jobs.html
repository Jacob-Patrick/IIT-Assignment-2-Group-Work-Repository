			<p> As part of our individual tasks in assignment 1, we each chose an advertisement for a position that we would consider to be our ideal job. Our ideal jobs our listed below along with a description of each, so that we may analyse and compare them for common elements and differences. We have also included a brief plan of steps to take in order to become qualified for these positions.  </p>

			<p> Jordan has chosen Head of IT at West Technology in Sydney. This is a leadership role reporting directly to the company CEO and involves not only maintaining the IT infrastructure of the company but also communicating with other areas of the business and of course leading the rest of the IT department. He has plenty of experience in Leadership and Management and using those skills in an IT setting would allow for more job options and in this case quite a large expected rate of pay.  </p>
			<p> This is a Management position and Jordan has worked in Management for several years so he believes that his prior experience would be beneficial. He also has several Management Certificates.  </p>
			<p> Jordan believes that his first step towards the skills and requirements for this position would be to successfully complete the Bachelor of IT, as well as continue his work in management to build as many skills as he can. Next, he would want to gain experience in the IT industry and work towards an IT Management position to gain the IT Management experience required, and specifically experience in system migration and integration.  </p>

					<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Customer Solutions Architect - Murray</h2>
				<div id="main">
			<div class="box">
<br>
			<img width="250" height="460" src="Ideal Job Files/Ideal Job Murray.jpg" alt="Murray Ideal Job" style="width:480px" />
			</div>
			
			<br>
			
			<p> In the simplest of terms, a Customer Solutions Architect takes a client’s desires and needs for their network and makes it into a reality. They are depended upon by all facets of a business for their technical expertise and ability to make customers happy and make money for a business. Murray likes the role as it involves problem solving and vast technical knowledge. It also requires some customer service which he is already competent at, without it being necessary for success in the role.  </p>
			<p> CSAs must have a proven knowledge of network architecture and current products. They must have certificates to show this ability such as CCNA (switching and networking) and CCNP, along with other vendor certificates that aren’t CISCO based, such as Juniper. You will need some years of professional experience in a Similar role as there is a lot expected of you from various stakeholders in the business. He currently does not have any of the certificates, although before he started his current role, he was studying for his CCNA. Murray thinks the first step will be to complete the CCNA, then move on to more technical CISCO certs. At the same time, he would also like to complete certs from AWS, Google and Microsoft for their cloud products. In the long run, Murray would like to be a CSA specialising in cloud.  </p>

			<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Artificial Intelligence Specialist - Raj</h2>
			
			<br>
			INSERT IMAGE
			<br>
			
			<p> Raj has always wanted to work with software companies in the healthcare industry. He knows that artificial intelligence will play a serious role in the future, especially in the healthcare industry.  LBT INNOVATION is one of the famous AI companies for developing advanced technology solutions for the healthcare industry. They have a great reputation in clinical laboratories for developing AI based solutions. I come from a strong and solid mechanical knowledge and experience. So, I am hoping that I am one of the promising candidates for them when I achieve excellent knowledge and experience from other companies.   </p>
			
			<p> Raj’s plan is to complete his undergraduate course successfully (Bachelor of IT) before he will have to gain a strong knowledge and experience in Machine learning artificial intelligence.  He needs to study an additional course in Python and Unix along with Bachelor of IT. He needs to have excellent experience with healthcare data and solutions, so that he will have experience in R&D using AI tools and techniques. He plans to gain internship experience in any of the AI companies to have excellent experience in source controls, Machine learning, Deep learning and advanced technologies in AI. He will also discuss with his RMIT tutors for guidance to meet the requirements  </p>

			<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Fronted Software Engineer - Jake</h2>
			
			<br>
			INSERT IMAGE
			<br>
			
			<p> This is a remote position is for an experienced front end software engineer. This role would involve liaising with the organisation’s creative and business analysis team to design and build software for the client with the goal of streamlining and automating their processes.    </p>
			<p> Front end appeals to Jake as it involves working with products that he considers to be tangible (such as an app or a website) and he likes to be able to visually see or interact with what he is working on. Jake is an organised person who likes to tick boxes and he believes that he would take great satisfaction in taking a brief all the way to a final and optimised product.   </p>
			<p> Jake believes that his best course of action to qualify for this role is to complete the bachelor of IT and utilise any opportunities to practice with different tools and programming languages and try to keep up with industry trends. He also believes it to be vital that to start building a portfolio of any design or programming work that he does and probably most importantly would be to get an entry level job in IT where he can hone his skills and gain some real industry experience with which to use as a steppingstone to his ideal job.   </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Data Science Engineer - Ben</h2>
		
			<br>
			INSERT IMAGE
			<br>
			
			<p> Ben decided to have a look at a job that was slightly different to standard career paths this course would usually lead to and was rather intrigued. Using experience brought about from an interest in the IT field, a job as a data scientist requires the use of practical code knowledge, statistical awareness and using these to assist a business with trend and scope identification.   </p>
			<p> This appears to be how it sits within the scope of this job as well, along with requiring one to be able to prototype tests based on returned results, providing optimal solutions and usage of one’s abilities to assist the business forecast future business transitions and changes for the inevitable benefit of the company    </p>
			<p> If he were to work towards a role in the Data Science field, Ben would need to develop and get a better understanding behind coding as well as develop an understanding of data from a more statistical point of view. As someone who has always had a keen interest in puzzles, complex challenges and the like, this type of role has certainly caught his intrigue.   </p>

				<h3 style=color:#090b85; >Similarities and Differences between team members Ideal Jobs:</h3>
			
			<br>
			INSERT TABLE
			<br>
			
			<p> These key elements have been taken from the individual members’ own descriptions and interpretations of their advertisements as well as the advertisements themselves. This means that they may not necessarily include all the job elements as described by the ads but may be indicative of the elements given most emphasis by the employer or the elements that are most important to each member in their ideal position.   </p>
			<p> It may not be surprising from a group of IT students to note that we have all chosen roles that require a certain level of technical expertise. While there are varying levels of technical expertise required in these roles, we have all identified that we will require further technical training or work experience in addition to the bachelor of IT to qualify for these roles.   </p>
			<p> It may be more surprising to note that each job description demands a high level of communication skills. Whether it be liaising with different internal departments, colleagues, superiors, juniors, clients or other stakeholders, each role requires a lot more communication skills than the stereotypical introverted IT worker of the movies has. In fact, it seems that the introverted among us must learn to step out of our shells in order to be successful in this industry.   </p>
			<p> A few differences are apparent from this table too, namely that Jordan and Sneha have chosen managerial/leadership roles. This is not surprising given their natural leadership skills as demonstrated by their career experience and personality test results.   </p>
			<p> While a lot of these positions may be performed remotely and may include elements of remote work, Jake was the only group member to choose a specifically remote position. Murray and Sneha were the only members to choose positions with a heavy focus on customer service.    </p>
			<p> In addition to the information gathered from the table above, we can also identify many trends in the specific plans to obtain these jobs as identified by the individuals. Some common themes include, continuing the Bachelor of IT to completion; learning specific tools, coding languages and techniques; further training and education including specific technical certificates and managerial certificates; and gaining industry experience through either relevant current employment, entry level IT jobs or internships.   </p>
