				<p> We as a group are fascinated by the developments happening in the IT world and are excited by what the future may hold for our industry. Many historic technological developments have changed the way the world works today. We have lived through the initiation of personal computing and internet. We now live in the ‘smart’ era, with smart phones, smart tv’s and smart watches and satellite technology. Our lives are dominated by social media, cloud computing and online privacy and data concerns. We live in the infancy of Artificial Intelligence. Here we have taken the time to examine four growing areas of IT in further detail: Cloud, Service and Server-Based Computing; Cyber Security; Robotics; and Machine Learning. We have discussed what these technologies do, what their likely impact is and how they will affect us personally and as a society.  
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Cloud, Service and Server-Based Computing </h2>
				
				<br>
				<li><b> What does it do? </b></li>
			
			
				<p>Cloud computing when boiled down to its basics is the use of technology to create an environment where information and data can be stored in a central location that can then be accessed from anywhere in the world. Using the internet, resources such as mass data storage, servers, databases and software become readily available for usage across the globe. 
				<br>
				<P>This in turn effectively negates the requirement for local storage solutions such as standard local hard-drives and server systems, as cloud solutions allow for greater flexibility with your data. Whether it be due to requiring the ability to access data remotely, have an increased level of security or just a safe storage location for ones data with a high level of redundancy, cloud based data servers and services tend to trump that of local storage solutions in every way.  
				<br>
				<p>In today’s environment, the use of cloud computing and solutions are highly populated and sought after by big businesses and individuals alike. Businesses in particular benefit from Cloud Computing well beyond what was envisioned only 10 to 15 years ago, when systems such as Dropbox and AWS were in their infancy. An example of this is the sheer cost savings that businesses can achieve when working off entirely cloud-based server systems. For many years’ past, large-scale businesses would have to set aside a physical space where they would have to then fund and build large data storage facilities. After which this space would need to be maintained and managed on site, with full scalability factor being integrated pre-build to accommodate further company growth. This is especially time consuming, and expensive on the business. 
				<br>
				<p>This exact issue is made even more apparent when you look at this same idea however this time, from the perspective of a small business looking at growing. How much storage would a company need in order to grow at a scalable rate, without either running into issues created by taking off and suddenly running into a lack of storage space, or funding problems due to overcompensation. In both instances, if not balanced well initially, this could effectively make or break a business. 
				<br>
				<P>This is where systems such as the hugely successful Amazon AWS come into effect. AWS offer cloud-based storage services for businesses for companies of any size. They offer all the necessary tools required to create a self-contained storage system on the web, charge the business for what storage and functions they use, as well as seamlessly allowing existing businesses to migrate data directly from local storage facilities onto the AWS systems. And this is just one large example of cloud-based services.  
				<br>
				<p>More simple systems such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive are equally as prevalent in our current everyday lives. Over the last 10 years these systems have really begun to encapsulate the world, whether it be through the automatic use of Google Photos synchronisation on Android phones backing up your photos to a linked Google Account, or the use of DropBox to share music files between friends remotely. These are all cloud-based systems that are actively used by individuals and businesses alike on a day to day basis. And it is all in the name of convenience and data security. Into the coming years Cloud Systems are going to continue to revolutionise how we interpret data, from a tangible source that is kept close to one’s fingertips, to a piece of information that is freely available for the individual to access wherever they want to in the world. 
				<br>
				
			
				<li><b> What is the likely impact?  </b></li>
			
			
				<p>The most immediate impact that cloud server/systems have had on the IT industry is the impact that had on the requirement for local data servers. Whether it is for a large-scale business requiring high levels of security, or small independents requiring minimal data storage space to operate. Physical on-site servers and storage just cannot compete with the cost efficiencies that Cloud Services offer. Comparing electrical costs, initial setup costs of storage bases and general maintenance costs for a local storage facility, or the ability to pay for amount of storage used, as well as the required service level. For any business, this really is becoming a question of when, rather than if.
				<br>
				<p>Change in this space is happening in front of our eyes as well. The use of USB’s for data transferring and sharing has been quickly replaced with file sharing services available online. Physical landlines and even VOIP based systems are being replaced with AWS phone systems, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and the like. Systems that are hosted and managed entirely cloud-based systems for use globally by anyone. All that is required is an internet connection and a phone or laptop.  
				<br>
				<p>From a business perspective, these changes are immense. But even to the individual, the effects of cloud systems is evident in day-to-day life. More people are online than ever before, and the requirement to always be available at the press of a button. This is the same for humans and data alike. Always available, from anywhere. 
				<br>
				<p>In this sentiment, the rise of cloud-based systems has created an entirely new range of job types to the market. Cloud engineers are required to manage the businesses cloud-based servers and systems. Whether it is in migrating data from physical data centres to the cloud, or even just management over the cloud system in use, there is always going to be the need for this to be maintained from a business perspective. This creates jobs for network engineers, where they might’ve otherwise lost work due to the redundancy created by the removal of local server systems. 
				<br>
				
				
				<li><b> How will this affect you?   </b></li>
			
				<p>Imagine this. You accidently drop your phone while out walking, smashing it, and ruining it entirely. What happens to all the data kept on it? Is it all lost, photos, texts, and documents kept on it all gone in an instant? This is not even remotely the case and has not been a problem for a couple of years now. 
				<br>
				<p>These are the fears of yesteryear. For the most part, all phones that are purchased are linked directly to some form of association account before you even get into it. Whether it is a Google account, Apple account or other associated account, this has become a requirement. Then while actively being used, most automatic backups are running at all times, moving locally taken photos, messages and general data off the phone and onto a cloud-hosted storage system that only those with the account details can access.
				<br>
				<p>Data loss is minimal, if it exists at all, and data recovery is easier than ever. No more loss of precious photos and memories and no more lost homework for school assignments due to hardware failures. For individuals, cloud hosting has become integrated into our everyday lives, most of it slipping in almost unnoticed but always being used for the better of everyone. Whether it is for easier access to emails, online banking and data extraction from anywhere in the world, to managing and operating a business from home, we have allowed for cloud computing to establish itself into our everyday lives. Its cost effectiveness, ease of access and secure nature means that it is available for everyone to use as they please, and it is not going away in a hurry.

				<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Machine Learning  </h2>
				
				
				<p> We are living in a defining period of human history – The period where computing moved from large mainframe computers to personal computers to Cloud computing. Machine learning (ML) is becoming more and more predominant. Advanced computer technology in this era has led to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is a rapidly growing technology in the healthcare, automobile, telecommunications and internet sectors now.  
				<br>
				<p> Machine learning algorithms provide the machine or device the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.  Machine learning algorithms are classified into four types – supervised, semi supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. The process of learning starts with observations, training data or inputs. These can include examples, direct experience or instructions that are used to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. For example, when people visit an online shopping website, the website gives visitors reminders such as ‘related searches’ or ‘people also bought this item with this’. Machine learning can be trained to look at images, identify abnormalities and point to areas needing to attention thus improving the accuracy of all these processes. 
				<br>
				<p>Machine learning is a process of directing a computer system to make accurate predictions when fed data. With the help of Machine learning, we achieve effective web searches, precision speech recognition and advanced autonomous vehicles. Training data or data inputs are the medium to teach computers or machines to solve the problems and answer the questions. Explicit programming is not required, and minimum human involvement is needed for this technology. The learning process is automated and is based on the experience of the machine through its processes. 
				<br>
				<p> Machine learning techniques are used in various sectors and technology areas like computational finance, image-voice-motion recognition industry, healthcare, automotive, aerospace and manufacturing. 
				
				
	
					<ul>
						<ul>
							<li> We can find machine learning techniques even in mobile applications and websites like Amazon, eBay and Netflix to recommend users to buy or watch products or services. Our planet is slowly becoming familiar with ML.   </li>
							<li> Most of the smart phones, smart televisions and smart watches are using ML technology to improve their efficiency. Virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana all work with perfect precision because of machine learning technology.  </li>
							<li> The automotive industry uses ML for mind-blowing innovations. Most automobile manufacturers produce software to enable data gathering from the vehicle’s operation. A UK based company called Spark is in the middle of developing a technology based on ML that calculates the range of miles an Electric Vehicle can travel after full charge. This technology gathers information from man-driven or autonomous vehicle about terrain and driving behavior and then calculates the milage of the Electric vehicle.   </li>
							<li> Advanced ML technologies are being implemented in the automobile industry for driverless car concepts and driver assistance. Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) technology can detect objects, alert the driver of dangerous road conditions and slow and stop vehicles.  </li>
							<li> Autonomous vehicles are not a science fictional object anymore. Machine learning technology will play a key role to safely navigate the streets during rush hour traffic.  </li>
							<li> Machine learning is slowly changing the shape of the healthcare industry now by assisting healthcare professionals to do the critical tasks of identifying diseases and diagnosis, drug discovery and manufacturing, medical image diagnosis, advanced radiology and clinical trials and researches. </li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			
				<p>  Humans can compute and analyse large volumes of data with the help of advanced machine learning technology’s improved and unsupervised algorithms. There is plenty of research and trials being carried out around the globe that will lead us to be able to perform complex tasks quickly, efficiently and safely in all sectors from healthcare to aerospace. Use of robots will increase in business and personal activities because of continuous research and improvements of Machine learning.
				<br>
				<p> There are some disadvantages of ML just like every bright side has some darker version in it. 
				
				<ul>
						<ul>
						<li> It may be that machine learning technology will make humans lazy. Imagine when a robot does the stock take, prepares the shopping list and does the shopping for the entire family in the future. Machine learning will provide outstanding personalised experience in all kind of businesses but there is a chance of humans to become lazy.   </li>
						<li> Machine learning technology enabled machines, devices, robots and techniques will cause unemployment in various sectors. Robots have replaced humans in many areas of automobile and manufacturing factories like packing, welding, painting, and logistic activities. Most organisations have already started to replace human with robots like Bionic Bar in a Royal Caribbean cruise. There are two robotic bar attenders in Bionic Bar and they do all kinds of bar attender tasks efficiently and quickly.  </li>
						<li> There are endless benefits to using Machine learning technology in the healthcare sector but a mismatch in data due to a change of environment or circumstances can end up with disastrous results. There is a requirement for ‘out of the box thinking’ while carrying out a surgery or a clinical trial or research. ML enabled devices can perform only according to the training data or programs. A patient’s life can be in danger if is an error occurred while a robot doctor doing a heart surgery with its machine learning algorithms. </li>
						<li> Self-driving cars are not a myth anymore, but they should work as smart as humans. AI and ML powered cars can perform with excellency but there are some safety and security issues when it stops working in the middle of the freeway or someone hacked the control system while using self-driving cars.  </li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
				
				<p> Machine Learning will be one of the powerful technologies in the future which will make a deep impact on the life of humans.  </p>
				
				
				<ul>
					<ul>
				<li> A powerful and efficient Machine learning technology will reduce human errors because humans can make mistakes, but computers and devices won’t if fed the proper training data inputs and programmed accurately.   </li>
				<li> Services and products will be available 24 x7 because technology will replace humans in the future. Normally humans can work 4-6 hours without taking any breaks, but ML can make machines, robots and technologies work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even make any complaints like, ‘I am bored’! </li>
				<li> Top companies are already executing robots for assisting customers in various industries. Dinosaur robots are welcoming guests In Henn Na Hotel, Japan. A tech company called ABB opened its first healthcare research lab in Texas to manufacture robots for the healthcare industry.  According to the Hospital + Healthcare magazine, ABB will produce robots which are able to do the highly skilled tasks required in medical and laboratory work. These stories are pointing towards one fact; there will be a strong presence of robots in most industries with the help of ML technology.  </li>
				<li> ML technologies enabled virtual assistants becoming popular now to do household activities and assistants and robots may not only do most of the household activities from cooking to cleaning, but also will do the caretakers job and look after the elderly people.  </li>
				<li> Machine learning enabled robots and equipment will do the dangerous and risky jobs in the future. It may be that robots will perform as a fireman or an army person who can enter deadly circumstances. Scientists will utilise machine learning enabled devices in the deep ocean or even on Jupiter!  </li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				
				<p> Machine leaning technologies have astonishing advantages and scary disadvantages, but researches and trials are being carried out everywhere to minimise the risks to create a better world. Machine learning has enormous potential to change the face of technology.  </p>

		<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Robots </h2>
				
				<p> The word ‘robot’ is very much familiar nowadays, thanks to their role in blockbuster Hollywood science fiction movies such as Star Wars, The Terminator and the Star Trek series. People often think that a robot is simply a machine that looks like a human and imitates a human, but a robot is much more than that.   </p>
				<p> A robot is a mechanical or virtual, artificial agent. It is a stand-alone hybrid computer system that performs physical and computational activities. The word robot can refer to both physical and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as ‘bots’ to differentiate. Asimo, one of the world’s most advanced robots, manufactured by the Honda Motor Company, has a human like appearance and is able to walk, run forwards and backwards, and hop on one or two legs continuously. It evaluates inputs from multiple sensors that are equivalent to the visual, auditory and tactile senses of a human being. It then estimates the circumstances of its surrounding environment to determine the corresponding behavior of the robot!  </p>
				<p> Robots are available on the market in all shapes and sizes according to their assigned tasks. There are Pre-Programmed Robots, Humanoid Robots, Autonomous Robots, Teleoperated Robots and Augmenting Robots. A Collaborative Robot (Cobot) is a non-intelligent robot; it can be easily programmed, for example, to pick up an object and place it elsewhere and it will continue to do the same task until it is turned off. Cobots do not need any human inputs after they have been programmed. This task does not require any intelligence because the Cobot will never change what it is doing. Most industrial robots are non-intelligent. Pre-programmed robots are most commonly used in the manufacturing sector to do autonomous tasks like welding, packing, palatizing, painting and assembling parts. Robotics is an inter disciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of mechanical robots. We can see various types of industrial robots use in all sectors such as logistics, home, automobile, healthcare and aerospace to name a few.  </p>
				<p> Robots are programmable and reprogrammable machines that are able to do tasks autonomously with the help of robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Robotics, a branch of technology, is all about designing, building and programming physical robots which can interact with its surroundings. With the help of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning technologies (ML), advanced robots can tackle learning, perception, problem solving, language-understanding, logical reasoning and face and motion recognition and analysis.  </p>
				<p> The robot revolution has arrived and developing robotics is the next stage of automation. Robotics is already integrated in many aspects our daily life.   </p>
			
			<ul>
				<ul>
				<li> During the Covid19 pandemic season, many hospitals and hotels including Stanly Hospital, India had deployed robots to serve food, medicines and bed linen to Covid19 infected patients. Autonomous internal delivery robots will be very popular in hospitals, hotels, warehouses, factories and malls for secure deliveries.  </li>
				<li> DoorDash and Amazon are using autonomous robots to deliver goods to their customers in California. Small sized delivery robots collect food from restaurants and travel to homes to deliver food while Scout – the Amazon delivery robot - collects parcels from the nearest distribution point and delivers them to Amazon prime customers. So, there will be plenty of delivery robots in the streets.   </li>
				<li> Restaurants, bars, hotels and other industries will appoint more mobile autonomous robots to look after their customers in upcoming days. Amy, a multifunctional autonomous mobile robot is working as a waiter in Dadawan restaurant in Maastricht, Netherlands to reduce the risk of spreading Covid19 virus.  Amy can greet the customers, interact with customers, deliver food and beverages and can avoid obstacles with the help of advanced robotics technology, sensors and AI/ML enabled software.   </li>
				<li> Robear, a bear shaped experimental nursing robot developed by Scientists from a Japanese company called Riken is able to perform tasks like lifting a person from their bed into a wheel chair or assist a patient to stand up with the help of advanced elements like smart rubber tactile and torque sensors. In future, many healthcare professionals in hospitals may be replaced by autonomous robots for performing highly skilled tasks including diagnosis and surgery.  </li>
				<li> Robots can save employees from performing dangerous tasks and work in hazardous conditions such as fast paced repetitive jobs, poor lighting environments and work with toxic chemicals. Another advantage of robots is that they can lift heavy loads without injury or tiring. So, robots will replace humans to avoid occupational health and safety related issues.   </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>	
			
			<p>Robots can complete tasks faster and more efficiently than humans, however, despite many advantages there are clear disadvantages with robotics. </p>
				
			<ul>
				<ul>
				<li> One of the serious concerns about introducing robots into society is the impact of jobs for workers. Industrial robots, delivery robots, commercial cleaning robots, nursing robots, food and beverages attendant robots, special purpose cobots and all kinds of robots will replace millions of jobs in the future.  </li>
				<li> Robotic drones and other weapons that can target and destroy without human supervision will be a big threat for humans. Robotics could lead humans to relinquish control over decisions to use lethal force. Killer robots and other autonomous weapons could operate on land, in the air or at sea without empathy and judgment; the aftermath of killer robot attacks will be worse than the Hiroshima – Nagasaki nuclear attacks.  </li>
				<li> Robots are machines - unexpected errors or malfunctions like power failure can occur while performing a critical task and that kind of mechanical failure or a software crash will give very dangerous results. </li>
				<li> Sooner or later robots will develop a level of sentience that enable them to make decisions for themselves, so there is a possibility that robots might take over the world and that will cause a serious threat for humans.  </li>
				<li> People are no longer doing some activities now that were popular in the past. Things like writing a letter, using a real map, visiting libraries are not as common anymore because people are relying on internet and mobile phones to do these kinds of tasks. Based on this behavior of humans, Robots may reduce most of human capabilities in future.  </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
				
				<p> Robots are already playing a vital role in society and their involvement in human’s day to day life will increase in the future. Robots will provide new levels of safety, efficiency, accuracy and productivity. One robot can perform relatively few tasks now, but they will eventually perform most of the tasks that a human can do. Robot maids may do most of the work in the home including looking after kids and pets, assisting elderly people, cooking, shopping and all kinds of other housework. Most people are forced to send their parents to aged care because they must go to the office, and no one is at home to look after their parents. A caretaker or nursing humanoid robot will fix that issue for sure. </p>
				<p> Dubai police have deployed their robot police officers, assigned the task of patrolling the city’s malls and tourist attractions. In the future of the robot, officers in police, army, navy and air force will play an important role to handle crime, wars and other military related activities. Humanoid robot teachers and lecturers may take over classrooms around the world, with new teaching methods and styles. Robots may become a life partner or best friend in the future. Humanoid robots could become an emotionally intelligent companion that are capable of long-term relationships with humans by fulfilling all kinds of desires with the help of artificial intelligence and ML.  </p>
				<p> Robots will perform all sort of tasks in the future, from housework to helping children with autism and they will have the capability to improve our life. Purchasing a childcare humanoid robot will be very useful for working parents to look after their kids but there are serious concerns about the child’s safety; childcare humanoid robots could be a threat to a child at any age, so advanced research and experiments and trials are required to avoid robotic hazards.   </p>

	<h2 style=color:#090b85; > Cyber Crime </h2>

<br>
				<li><b> What does it do? </b></li>
			
				<p> Whether you are accessing your banking online or surfing the web from the comfort of your home, Cybersecurity plays a pivotal role in our society today without people even realising it; and aspects of cybersecurity are continually at work. Cybersecurity refers to the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthori[s]ed access” (Lord, 2019). Also often referred to as information technology security and is critical to networking/ business security </p>
				<p> With computer hackers constantly finding new, easy methods of access sensitive information stored on servers around the world, cyber security professionals, or information security analysts have a wide range of responsibilities, such as fighting off cybercrime, protect online data from being compromised, committed to offering superior security solutions. On the job, cyber security IT professionals can expect to safeguard an organisations files, install software and encryption reporting breaches or weak spots, researching IT trends, educating the entire organisation on security – and even simulating security attacks to find potential vulnerabilities (Rasmussen College, 2020). Lord (2019) mentions that “a significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthori[s]ed access or exposure could have negative consequences.”.  </p>

				<p>  Often it has been argued that a key negative attribute of the advancement of technology have opened us up to new threats of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks can cause electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment and breaches of national security. They can result in the theft of valuable, sensitive data like medical records. They can disrupt phone and computer networks or paralyse systems, making data unavailable.   </p>
				<p><i> 5 top cyber threats:</i></p>
				
			<ul>
				<li> Ransomware  </li>
				<li> Phishing  </li>
				<li> Data Leakage  </li>
				<li> Hacking  </li>
				<li>Insider Threat  </li>
			</ul>	
				
				<p> Computer hackers can break into computer systems unauthorised to steal, change and/or destroy information, often by means of installing dangerous malware in the absence of your knowledge or consent (webroot.com, 2019). Hackers have been known to use various methods to obtain people’s restricted private information. Imagine this: you open your computer to check your bank account, not having any idea that you’ve opened the gateway for hackers to gain access to your computer and personal information which you thought was secure. </p>
				<p> There are many ways predators access your personal information but below I have outlined some key methods by which hackers misuse technology and invariably impact individuals:  </p>

			<ul>
				<li> Hijack your usernames and passwords   </li>
				<li> Access and steal money and open credit card and bank accounts in your name   </li>
				<li> Ruin your credit   </li>
				<li> Request new account Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or additional credit cards  </li>
				<li> Make purchases   </li>
				<li> Add themselves or an alias that they control as an authorised user so it’s easier to use your credit   </li>
				<li> Obtain cash advances   </li>
				<li> Use and abuse your Social Security number   </li>
				<li> Sell your information to other parties who will use it for illicit or illegal purposes   </li>
			</ul>

				<p> Online predators pose a serious threat which can lead to not only online stalking but also in the real world. It is important to be extra careful when agreeing to meet someone in person after being befriended online(ref). There are several things one can do to safeguard the security of your personal information: be cautious of the personal information that is posted online, change passwords frequently, utilise a two-way firewall; and not accepting friend requests from people you do not know on social networking sites. Additionally, using a spam filter or gateway to scan inbound email or instant messages is advantageous in protecting your computer from hackers (ref). It may also be helpful to use a password manager application which creates a complex alpha numeric password (i.e. encrypted digital vault) and then will save the password in the application. This will eliminate the need to jot down the passwords or utilise the same password for multiple sites. Using the same passwords on various websites gives hackers access to all your personal information by just having just one of your passwords.   </p>
				<p> Now more than ever, cyber security plays an integral part in the business world, which can impact all aspects of daily operations making sure that businesses operate effectively. Often people assume that only large co-operations can get impacted by cyber-attacks. However, this is not entirely true. Businesses of all sizes must be mindful of the dangers that cyber-attacks can pose. “From email correspondence and financial transactions, to professional networking and collaborative work documents, businesses rely on technology to be connected at all times and conduct work effectively.” (itproportal.com, 2019).  Any of these daily business activities such as communications or transactions are comprised to computer hacking would be detrimental to the viability of the business.   </p>

				<li><b> What is the likely impact?  </b></li>
				<p> Cybercrime generates many headlines with breaches impacting major corporations and computing systems of government agencies being shut down to ransom. But cybercrime doesn’t just impact large organisations, it affects millions of individuals who can be susceptible to a range of cyberattacks ranging from data theft and ransomware that is used to target organisations to more personal attacks that aim to simply cause chaos and distress. Some common types of cybercrime that can affect you are cyber abuse, online image abuse, online shopping fraud or romance fraud, identity theft, email compromise, internet fraud, ransomware, money laundering etc.    </p>
				<p> With a broad range of crimes related to cyber-attacks, the issue of impact to the wider community is fundamental. New advances in technology, development of methods, so does the increase of cyber-attacks each year. Some IT industry professionals believe that 2021 will see a new progression in the field of cyber security with the emergence of crypto agility. With computing power increasing each and every year, it also brings along added threat to current security protocols. Crypto Agility will play a big part in the ability for hackers to be able to break static algorithms with little or no trouble. This means that businesses will now need to implement systems that can randomly change the algorithms and limit the ability for hacks to occurs. Industry professionals have also mentioned that it is possible that by next year AI will also play a big part in the cyber world. “Creating a new breed of AI powered malware, hackers will infect an organisations system using the malware and sit undetected gathering information about users’ behaviors, and organisations systems. Adapting to its surroundings, the malware will unleash a series of bespoke attacks targeted to take down a company from the inside out.” (securityboulevard.com, 2019).  The complexity of such attacks will be something that has never been seen in the cybersecurity world.  Therefore, it is a given that this will cause issues in the near future. To secure such a threat, the business world and cybersecurity professionals of the world will need to implement the use of AI technology as well.  Subsequently, the implementation of such security measures needs to start in the board room and work its way down throughout the company to secure company equipment.   </p>
				<p>	In conclusion, fighting cyber-attacks on systems is crucial, one which every individual has a role to play. Incorporating simple measures such as password management and being aware of sites you visit, and ensuring you are aware of emails that are accessing while on your device helps to minimise the risk being exposed to a hacker. With this growing problem there is a continual need for cyber-crime professional to ensure the safety of businesses and individuals alike.   </p>
