					<h2 style=color:#090b85;>Interview with an Industry Professional</h2>
					
			<p>	We devote a substantial amount of time at work, which is why a higher sense of satisfaction through meaningful work becomes integral to maintaining employees positive and productive behaviour. There is more to successful responses that meets the eye at a job interview. Generally, employees tend to ask behavioural or psychological type questions, for example:
			<li>“What are your strengths and weaknesses?”</li>
			<li>“What are areas of improvement?”</li>
			<li>“What is your ideal job? Why?”</li>
			<li>“Why do you believe that you are best suited for this role?”</li>
			<p>How can anyone really be prepared to know answers to such questions without having considered and/or having a clear understanding of their own personal goals, motivations and personalities. Utilising behavioural or psychological assessments provide a systematic evaluation of candidate personality profiles used to assess the viability of a candidate based on things like cultural fit, work style and potential.

			<br>
			<p>According to my results from the Myer Briggs Personality Test I am classed as a Protagonist (ENFJ-A) type. These individuals are extraverted, have an intuitive feeling, and judging personality trait. They are warm, forthright, and known to have strong ideological views and values. Protagonists are charismatic, born to be leaders, full of life. Often these group of individuals are best fit in political careers, leadership mentoring roles, and are seen in society as those who reach out and inspire others to achieve and to do good for the wider community.</p>

			<p><b>The Big Five Personality Test</b></p>
			
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:right;"> (Humanmetrics.com, 2020) </p>
			
			<br>
			<p>The Big Five Personality Test and Human metrics Jung Typology Test have shown similar results showing that as being Extroverted, Intuitive, more focused on Feelings, and place emphasis on Judging rather over perceiving. Moreover, these two tests also demonstrated that I am a visual learner. Visual learners be are best taught through drawing, building, inventing and creating. This is how this category of individuals process almost all information. Often, they are found to be book lovers and use pictures and text to gather knowledge. They engage in learning by using colours and diagrams and learn best from reading, videos, presentations and teacher handouts.  
</p>
			

			<p>Therefore, establishing a connection between my personality traits and my career pathway will not only help me in the future to reach my goal of obtaining my ideal job but also allow prospective employers to understand my overall strengths and weaknesses.
