<p><b>“Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?”</b></p>

					<p>L N - “I am a Senior Technical Consultant for a company called Servian, who deal with Tier 1 and 2 organisations with Australia and other regions. My primary focus lately has been cloud architecture or cloud native computing, things like Kubernetes or containerised applications with a pretty strong security focus. Basically helping enable enterprises to get the most out of their compute powers.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“Tell us a bit more about the industry that you work in?”</b></p>
					<p>L N - “ As a consultant I am not locked into a certain industry, I work across financial, airlines, media, telecom. Basically anyone who is willing to pay!” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What was the Education pathway that led you to the role you currently have?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “I started to study Computer Science at the University of Sydney, whilst also working part time doing system administration and IT support for a different organisation than the one I am currently working at. About halfway through my degree they offered me a full time position which I accepted. Then uni became something of the past and I never finished my degree.” </p>
<p>M N - “It sounds like you were still able to get somewhere in your career, is that with certifications?” </p>
<p>LN - “Yea so professionally I have got about 15 industry certifications across all of the cloud providers, VMware, Kubernetes even Oracle for some reason.” </p>
<p>M N - “Do you have to do the classic CISCO ones like CCNA?” </p>
<p>L N - “Not quite, I deal with things at a sort of more higher level. More general architectures rather than that low level interaction with the networking gear.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What was your professional pathway that led you to your current role?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So after the first organisation where I was the systems administrator, I was there for almost 5 years, then I took a position in my current organisation in their managed services division supporting a customer who was then running VMware. Then taking them on the journey from VMware to running on Amazon Web Services. At the time cloud wasn’t really a big thing, I mean it was a big thing but not many people were doing that sort of thing at this level within Australia, or the region at least. So I was given quite a lot of opportunity through large organisations and large projects to be doing a lot of cloud work early on in my career which really sort of gave me experience that nobody else really in the industry had or still has at this point. So that was able to project me out of managed services into consulting, pre-sales and architecture. </p>
<p>M N - “And when you say managed services, do you want to explain what that is?” </p>
<p>L N - Yea so managed services within our company it was IT support as a service with the ability to draw upon the greater consulting pool that my organisation has. So your basic level 1,2,3 IT support but also be able to have these larger projects and engagements off the back of that managed services. So uplifting from VMware to AWS for instance would be a larger project that is out of the scope of a normal MSP (Managed Services Provider), which is something we are able to do.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What other kind of work do you do in your role?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So I do pre-sales work, developing proof of concepts and MVPs to help us try and win work with our customers. I do sometimes the delivery of said work, actually deploying and working with teams there. I run a lot of workshops whether that is training or just discovery workshops with stakeholders to understand what their requirements are. Or training the technical engineers to be able to handle the environments once we built and deployed it for them. I am also a certified Google trainer so I am able to run technical training for external users, people who are signing up to users which is something my organisation does, running courses for the general public.” </p>
<p>M N - “So its not just really IT but you still have bits of other industries like sales and education rolled into your role.” </p>
<p>L N - “Yea well it is IT but it is not hands on IT work. </p>
<p>M N - “Yea so you’re not just sitting there on a PC hammering away 24/7, you’re actually sometimes have to be out there on a person to person level.” </p>
<p>L N - “Yea that’s exactly right, I would actually be doing the actual delivery work like 25-30% of the time.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“Who are the different people you interact with in your day to day work?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So from a pre-sales or an engagements perspective I deal with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. So non technical being your CTOs, Division and product owners or platform owners. So for instance if I was going in to try and deploy Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services I would be talking to the cloud or platform owner to find out their requirements, function and non-function requirements from their perspective. As well as talking to the technical stakeholders, your network engineers for IP site arranges, firewall ruling and interconnect questions. Your security engineers for security controls and policies for what we need to enforce within our design. Developers for how they actually want to interact and work with the systems. So talking to all the different stakeholders, all the different people, that have a buy in into this platform that we will be deploying so we can get the best solution design and deployed for them and actually get it designed and deployed within their constructs and constraints. </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What is our interactions with other IT professionals? You kind of touched on it before.”</b></p>
<p>L N - “ So from a pre-sales perspective talking about designing solution. But also from a workshop perspective I would be talking to the actual engineers who will be running the systems or solutions that we are developing after we leave. So we might be taking over as a managed services client, but if we are not and they are wanting to look after it themselves, oftentimes there is a degree of up-skilling required for their internal IT services and teams. So I will be running workshops and training them up on how they can work with this.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?” </p></b>
<p>L N - “So it is a bit split at the moment. So if we are talking about pre-sales, delivery and just sort of general training, workshop and up-skilling within my organisation and clients, it is more like probably evenly split across all of them. The thing that is probably right now taking up most of my time is pre-sales but a month ago it was delivery, so it shifts and changes any given week,” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“Just touching back on what you were talking about before, are you mostly interacting with IT professionals or something is it non IT people?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “Yea so sometimes it would be non IT people depending on who has a stake in what we are doing. So for the larger organisations, or larger projects rather, I get put into meetings with more senior C level people, CIOs and sometimes CEOs of these companies because it is a significant investment on their part to engage us and have this project. Often the return in investment would be huge but getting this involved, getting the right solution and partner, it is a huge investment from their perspective. So often we get this business side people involved in these meetings,” </p>
<p>M N - “I guess its the challenge of, not dumb it down, but work it in a more digestible way.” </p>
<p>L N -“Yea exactly right, yep.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“What aspects of your work do you find the most challenging?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So when I am trying to design a solution, like when I am trying to architect a cloud platform architecture for a customer, like I mentioned before we need to make sure network ranges are concise and we need to make sure we have the right site arrangers applied as well as security as well as features and functionality for developers as well as data structures enabled for data analysts. Its making sure all these things work, and with these large organisations each of these components have different teams and different silos of knowledge and requirements and needs and wants and for the larger organisations often times they are not communicating with each other. So you will get a security requirement that contradicts the networking or developer requirement and they are both saying ‘this needs to happen’ or ‘this can’t be happening’ and they contradict each other. Often times the solution is just getting them to talk to each other and educating them and getting them to understand the solution that we are putting forward and making them compromise but it is sometimes very difficult to design a solution that makes everyone happy. Some of time it is not possible so it is just making sure that we have that compromise.” </p>
<p>M N - “Yea so it sounds like it goes back to what we were saying before were it is not just all IT sometimes you have to be a mediator or an organiser.” </p>
<p>L N - “Yep.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“How has COVID impacted your role and the industry you work in?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So me personally, COVID has not made too much of a difference. When it hit and for 6 months after it started I continued to work for the client I was working with 6 months before it started. The only difference for me personally is that I was commuting down to Melbourne every week and in February that stopped. Even when I was commuting I was only commuting for 2-3 days and the other days I was just working from home so after the commuting stopped I just continued working from home full time. For me it don’t make any difference at all apart from less early mornings to the airport. For my organisation, we were quite lucky and it didn’t impact us too much at all. Like probably most business we had a hiring freeze, but we did not fire anyone or let anyone go. As far as the industry goes, as a consultancy we are generally an unnecessary expense for businesses, well not unnecessary, but it is usually for a project that is going to enhance something. It is not trying to put out a fire, its trying to build a new system or application or enhance the way things are happening, which should still give you an return on investment.” </p>
<p>M N - “But it’s still an investment.” </p>
<p>L N -“But it’s still an investment, yea business weren’t investing. Some of our customers cut back on the contract sizes we were dealing, some deals that were almost about to be signed were pulled away and finding work was a lot more difficult. A lot of large organisations I know of had a consulting and contractor freeze, so they weren’t actually allowed to engage people like our organisation because their directive from the top of their organisation that until there is more certainty in the industry or global economy we will just do BAU, business as usual.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“So what does your next role look like”</b></p>
<p>L N - “So what I am currently working towards is, so I am currently a Senior Consultant, I am looking over the next few months within the same organisation to transition in a Managing Consultant role which is a bit more hands off on delivery and a but more hands on with a whole array of different clients and just having an overview of them and supporting across multiple engagements, multiple customers, multiple teams and multiple consultants from my organisation and supporting them and helping them to deliver the products.” </p>
<p>M N - “So in your opinion IT has a lot of opportunity in terms of an industry in terms of growth? You see a lot of opportunity in it?” </p>
<p>L N - “For sure, everyday there is a new cool thing and every now and then a whole industry spawns off it. When I first started IT VMware, Virtual Machines, was the greatest thing that has ever happened and it was the future. That was never going to die away and I got certified in VMware and was focusing everything I wanted on VMware. Then cloud happened and now VMware is struggling to stay relevant basically at this point in time. Cloud has spawned so many industries itself, from the elastic computer, machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence and cloud native computing. All these things that used to be only available to your large organisations that are able to afford an entire data centre. It has now been democratised so that small to medium business are able to have a machine learning algorithm, do data processing. So the amount of work in IT and Consultancy across the board has just grown exponentially over the past 5-10 years.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>“Finally, can you share one example from the work that you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?”</b></p>
<p>L N - “Yea I think getting these different teams to try and agree and talk to each other. I think the fact that you have to do that encapsulates the IT industry. There are all these teams and groups  that are locked in an engrained in their own ways, policies, procedures, toolsets. Trying to get them to integrate and work with other teams can be quite difficult. It is finding that compromise that is quite important.” </p>
<p>M N “And on the positive side, like you were saying before, it is such an elastic industry and every day there is something new.” </p>
<p>L N - “Yea for sure, My career starting at VMware gone to cloud gone to cloud native opportunities, things like Kubernetes and Containerised workloads and micro services. Then going to architecture and doing security reviews and training. It has been all over the place and this is just where new cool technologies have spawned and created entire industries based of a single system, a single application, like Kubernetes.” </p>
<p>M N - “You have also been able to travel the world for your work as well.” </p>
<p>L N - “Yea I do conference around the place, I work with clients in Japan, Singapore, New Zealand. I have been to conferences in Copenhagen and America. It has been an exciting journey.” </p>
